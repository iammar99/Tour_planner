## What is Tour Planner?
Tour Planner is an interactive web application designed to assist travelers in planning their trips. By asking users about their destination, time range, and preferences, it generates a personalized travel itinerary. The application provides information about local attractions, restaurants, and activities, along with images to enhance the user's experience.


## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **APIs**: Integration with GPT-4 for generating travel-related suggestions and Unsplash API for fetching images of destinations and places of interest.


## How Does It Work?
1. **User Input**: Users enter their desired destination through an intuitive input form.
2. **Data Retrieval**: The application queries a database or API to gather information about the specified location, including must-visit attractions and local dining options.
3. **Itinerary Generation**: Based on the retrieved data, the application compiles a customized travel guide that includes:
   - Recommended restaurants for meals.
   - Suggested places to visit.
   - Activities to engage in during the trip.
   - Images for better visualization of each location.
4. **Output Display**: The generated itinerary is displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing users to easily plan their trips.

## Why Is It Needed?
Travel planning can often be overwhelming, especially for those unfamiliar with a destination. Tour Planner simplifies this process by providing curated information tailored to users' preferences, ensuring a more enjoyable and organized travel experience. It helps travelers discover hidden gems and popular spots, making the most of their time at each destination.
